The Scion CRS calculator : 
Very basic CRS score calculator build out of minimal react. 
The compiled javascript module(CRSLogic.js) and css module(CRSCss.css) in the public folder is for the webflow custom code . 
Whatever changes needs to be reflected in the webflow must be made in the crs.js and crs.css 
Also static images are being supplied through 'ScionLogo' file it MUST NOT BE DELETED, it is for the Logo in the calculator 
In order to change the crs.js custom code, just transcribe the react using babel or any jsx parser and replace the file with the updated one.
